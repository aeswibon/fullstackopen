# Part 1

In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.

## Requirements

- [x] Node
- [x] Yarn

## Setting up the Project

There is one application by folder, to start an application :

- Using Node:

```bash

# Head to the desired folder (courseinfo, unicafe or anecdotes)
cd anecdotes

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start

```

- Using Yarn:

```bash

# Head to the desired folder (courseinfo, unicafe or anecdotes)
cd anecdotes

# Install the dependencies
yarn install

# Start the application
yarn start

```

You can then access the app on : <http://localhost:3000/>
