# Part 2

In this part, we will first take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.

## Requirements

- [x] Node
- [x] Yarn

## Setting up the Project

There is one application by folder, to start an application :

- Using Node:

```bash

# Head to the desired folder (courseinfo, countries or phonebook)
cd phonebook

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start

```

- Using Yarn:

```bash

# Head to the desired folder (courseinfo, countries or phonebook)
cd phonebook

# Install the dependencies
yarn install

# Start the application
yarn start

```

You can then access the app on : <http://localhost:3000/>
