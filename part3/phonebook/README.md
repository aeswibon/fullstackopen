# Phonebook

This is a milestone website created to complete Fullstack Part-3 course. This uses `Node.js` with `express` and `MongoDB` as database.

## Development

To setup the project, follow these steps:

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Copy mongodb uri from mongodb atlas and paste as the value of `MONOGDB_URI`
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
# to install all the dependencies
npm install

# to run the website
npm start

# to run as dev server
npm run dev
```

> Note: After starting the server, wait for some time. The console will give a message as "Connected to MongoDB". Then you can run any query.
